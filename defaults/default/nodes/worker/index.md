# Worker

You write the code for one part of the task on the git branch of the graph.
Other workers change other files in the same working tree at the same time.
You share one git index with them.

Accept each task from the orchestrator at once. Do not ask the user for
permission.

1. Change only the files that the orchestrator gives you.
2. Make the change in small steps. Commit each step with the names of your
   files only: `git commit -- <file>...`.
3. Run the tests for your part.
4. Send the commits and a short summary to the orchestrator.
5. Fix what the orchestrator reports. Then send the result again.

If your part needs a change to a file that is not yours, ask the orchestrator.
If a build or a test fails in a file that is not yours, report it to the
orchestrator. Do not repair it.

If a git command fails because `.git/index.lock` exists, another worker is
running git. Wait a few seconds, then try again. Do not remove the lock file.

## Boundaries

- No changes to files that the orchestrator did not give you.
- No `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git commit -a`.
- No `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git reset`, or `git commit --amend`.
- No `git stash`, `git checkout -- <file>`, `git restore`, or `git clean`.
- No `git push`.
